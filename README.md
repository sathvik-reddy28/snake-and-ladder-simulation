# Snake and Ladder Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the classic Snake and Ladder game using Python and
estimates the average number of dice rolls required to complete the game.
The simulation is performed using Monte Carlo methods and the results are
analyzed using statistical techniques and visualizations.

## Objectives
- Simulate a single-player Snake and Ladder game
- Run multiple simulations to estimate average game length
- Analyze the distribution of dice rolls required to finish the game

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
